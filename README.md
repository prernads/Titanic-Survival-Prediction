# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
#This is the CodSoft task 1.
This repository contains a data science and machine learning project that aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this project uses a dataset with information about passengers, including their age, gender, class, and other features, to build and evaluate predictive models. The main objectives of this project are:

Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the demographics of the passengers and understand factors that might have influenced their survival.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the model's performance.

Model Building: Developing and training machine learning models to predict passenger survival using algorithms like Logistic Regression.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilizing techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

Visualization: Visualizing the results and insights from the analysis using matplotlib.
